This project is a simple yet effective password generator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to generate both strong and weak passwords based on their preferences. 
Additionally, the generator provides an indicator to help users determine the strength of the generated password. 
This helps users understand the security level of the password they've generated.
Users can specify the length of the generated password, allowing for flexibility based on specific requirements or constraints.
